          <p>
            The change in the state of an object is known as an Event. In html,
            there are various events which represents that some activity is
            performed by the user or by the browser. When javascript code is
            included in HTML, js react over these events and allow the
            execution. This process of reacting over the events is called Event
            Handling. Thus, js handles the HTML events via Event Handlers.

                  In user interface design for computer applications, a modal
                  window is a graphical control element subordinate to an
                  application's main window. A modal window creates a mode that
                  disables the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal
                  window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact
                  with the modal window before they can return to the parent
                  application. This avoids interrupting the workflow on the main
                  window. Modal windows are sometimes called heavy windows or
                  modal dialogs because they often display a dialog box.
